Suitability for Linear Regression:

Continuous Target Variable: The charges variable is continuous, making it appropriate for regression analysis.

Feature Types: The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features. Categorical variables like sex, smoker, and region can be encoded numerically.

Data Quality: The dataset is clean with no missing values, facilitating straightforward preprocessing.

ðŸ§­ Analysis Plan
a. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Inspection: Check for missing values and data types.

Statistical Summaries: Compute mean, median, standard deviation for numerical features.

Visualizations:

Histograms for feature distributions.

Box plots to identify outliers.

Correlation matrix to assess relationships between variables.

Scatter plots of charges against numerical features.

Bar plots for categorical features vs. charges.

b. Feature Selection
Encoding Categorical Variables: Apply one-hot encoding to sex, smoker, and region.

Multicollinearity Check: Calculate Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect multicollinearity.

Feature Importance: Use statistical methods like p-values from regression analysis to determine feature significance.
Medium

c. Model Training
Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).

Model Selection: Use scikit-learn's LinearRegression for model training.

Training: Fit the model on the training data.
